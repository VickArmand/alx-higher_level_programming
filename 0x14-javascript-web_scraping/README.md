<h1>Welcome to the adventures of JavaScript - Web scraping</h1>
<h4>General Objectives</h4>
<ul>
<li>Why JavaScript programming is amazing</li>
<li>How to manipulate JSON data</li>
<li>How to use request and fetch API</li>
<li>How to read and write a file using fs module</li>
</ul>
<b>Notes: Request module has been deprecated since February 2020 - the team is considering alternative to replace this module - however, itâ€™s a really simple and powerful module for practicing web-scraping in JavaScript (and still used a lot in the industry).</b>
